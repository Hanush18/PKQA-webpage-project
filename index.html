   <h3>Why Manual Testing Still Matters?
    <hr class="top"> 
   </h3> 
   
    <p>In today‚Äôs fast-paced software development world, where quick releases and rapid updates are the norm, automation has become a crucial part of the process‚Äîincluding in testing. Automated testing is great because it saves time, improves accuracy, and allows for repeatable tests. However, there are still situations where manual testing plays an essential role and cannot be replaced.</p>
        
       <p>Manual testing remains one of the most effective ways to catch critical bugs. It relies on human thinking, logic, and intuition to identify issues that automation might overlook. Since manual testing is performed from the end user's point of view, it helps ensure the product is user-friendly and provides a better overall experience.</p>
